# JUNKFROOT — Business Plan

### Mobile Fresh Juice Truck | Mississauga & Greater Toronto Area
### Prepared: February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Junkfroot** is a Black-owned mobile fresh juice venture founded by two lifelong friends — both 44-year-old Scarborough-born men of Trinidadian heritage. Junkfroot flips the script on "junk food" culture by delivering bold, Caribbean-inspired fresh juices, smoothies, and wellness shots from a branded mobile truck operating across Mississauga, Scarborough, and the Greater Toronto Area.

The name "Junkfroot" is intentional — it's provocative, memorable, and challenges assumptions. What looks like junk food energy is actually premium, cold-pressed, fruit-forward nutrition rooted in Caribbean tradition. Think sorrel juice, soursop blends, tamarind ginger shots, and mango-turmeric smoothies — flavours the founders grew up with in Scarborough's Trini community, now reimagined for the mainstream health-conscious market.

**Mission:** To bring authentic Caribbean-rooted juice culture to the GTA, build generational wealth as Black entrepreneurs, and prove that health and flavour don't have to compromise each other.

**Vision:** To become the GTA's leading mobile juice brand and scale into a multi-truck fleet, retail product line, and franchise model within five years.

**Founders:** Two Scarborough-born men, age 44, of Trinidadian descent. Combined, they bring decades of entrepreneurial drive, deep community roots in the Caribbean-Canadian diaspora, and a shared passion for health, culture, and food.

**Legal Structure:** Ontario Corporation (to be incorporated)

**Launch Target:** Summer 2026

**Initial Investment Required:** $95,000 – $130,000

**Year 1 Revenue Projection:** $180,000 – $280,000

**Year 2 Revenue Projection:** $300,000 – $450,000

## 3. Products & Menu

### Philosophy

## 4. Market Analysis

### Industry Overview

The Canadian juice and smoothie bar industry generates over $600 million annually and continues to grow at 4–6% per year, driven by health-conscious consumers, plant-based trends, and demand for convenient nutrition. The mobile food vendor segment has seen accelerated growth post-pandemic, with lower barriers to entry than traditional retail and strong event-based revenue potential.

### GTA Market Opportunity

- **Greater Toronto Area population:** 6.7+ million
- **Mississauga population:** 800,000+ (6th largest city in Canada)
- **Scarborough population:** 630,000+ (one of Toronto's most diverse districts)
- **Caribbean-Canadian population in GTA:** 400,000+ (one of the largest Caribbean diaspora communities outside the Caribbean)
- **Black population in GTA:** 500,000+ — significant concentration in Scarborough, Brampton, Mississauga, and North York

### Key Market Trends

1. **Health & Wellness Boom** — Post-pandemic acceleration of health-conscious eating, particularly among millennials and Gen X
2. **Cultural Food Renaissance** — Growing mainstream appetite for authentic Caribbean, African, and global flavours
3. **Mobile Vendor Growth** — Food trucks have become a permanent fixture at events, corporate campuses, and public spaces across the GTA
4. **Black Consumer Spending Power** — Black Canadians represent a growing economic force, with increasing demand for brands that reflect their culture and values
5. **Functional Beverages** — Sea moss, moringa, turmeric, and other Caribbean wellness ingredients are now trending nationally
6. **Social Media-Driven Brands** — Bold, visually distinctive brands with cultural stories outperform generic competitors on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube

### Seasonality Considerations

| Season | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **Summer (Jun–Sep)** | Peak season. Events, festivals, Caribana, waterfront locations. 60% of annual revenue. |
| **Fall (Oct–Nov)** | Corporate events, university campuses, farmers' markets. Warm shot menu introduced. |
| **Winter (Dec–Feb)** | Reduced truck operations. Focus on catering, pop-ups, online pre-orders, Christmas sorrel sales. |
| **Spring (Mar–May)** | Ramp-up. Farmers' markets return, fitness season demand increases, new menu launch. |

## 6. Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Booster Juice** | Chain (350+ locations) | Brand recognition, convenience | Generic menu, no cultural identity, franchise feel |
| **Freshii** | Chain (fast-casual) | Health positioning, corporate presence | Broad menu dilutes juice focus, recent financial challenges |
| **Jugo Juice** | Chain | Mall presence, variety | Declining brand relevance, no mobile presence |
| **Local Food Trucks** | Independent | Event presence, novelty | Few specialize in juice; most are food-focused |
| **Independent Juice Bars** | Retail | Premium positioning, local loyalty | Fixed locations, limited reach, high overhead |

### Indirect Competitors

- Grocery store cold-pressed juices (Greenhouse, Village Juicery)
- Tim Hortons / Starbucks smoothie offerings
- Home juicing trend

### Junkfroot Competitive Advantages

1. **Cultural Authenticity** — No other GTA juice brand is built on Caribbean flavour traditions with this level of intentionality
2. **Black-Owned Identity** — Strong alignment with growing consumer preference to support Black-owned businesses
3. **Mobility** — Can go where the customers are, unlike fixed-location competitors
4. **Brand Energy** — Streetwear-meets-wellness aesthetic stands out dramatically from sterile chain branding
5. **Community Roots** — Founders have authentic Scarborough/Trini connections that can't be manufactured
6. **Functional Caribbean Ingredients** — Sea moss, moringa, sorrel, and tamarind are trending but underrepresented in commercial juice offerings
7. **Story-Driven Marketing** — Two Scarborough men bringing their culture to the mainstream is a compelling narrative for media coverage
